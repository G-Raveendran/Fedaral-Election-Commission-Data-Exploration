# Fedaral-Election-Commission-Data-Exploration

# Overview
This project focuses on the exploration and analysis of Federal Election Commission (FEC) data using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset contains information on individual contributions to various candidates during a specific election cycle. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the data, such as identifying top contributors, understanding the distribution of contributions by party, and analyzing patterns based on occupation and employer.

# Analysis


# Contribution Analysis by Party
We analyze the contributions to each party by counting the number of transactions and summing the total contributions.

# Occupation Analysis
We create a pivot table to compare the contributions from different occupations to each party and focus on occupations contributing $1 million or more.

# Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth exploration of FEC data, allowing us to uncover patterns in political contributions. The analysis highlights the influence of different occupations, employers, and individual contributions on the election cycle.
Further analysis could include visualizations to compare contributions visually, deeper analysis into specific candidates, or trends across multiple election cycles.
